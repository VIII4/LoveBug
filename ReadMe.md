### Lovebug allows user to find a match based on comparisons of survey results. Lovebug also tracks matches allowing users to see all profiles and how many times they have matched. Lovebug api allows developers to retrieve all profiles in json format.

### Intructions

#### On home page, input desired username (will be alerted if user already exist), and input a web url where your profile pic is being host (will be alerted if input is not a url with image extension). If successful, you will be redirected to survey page with questions and optional additional info for bio. Once survey is completed, a modal will pop up with a match. select view all profiles to be directed to profile page or "bug em" to follow member(future feature).
